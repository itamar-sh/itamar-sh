### My Elevator Speech
Hi, I'm 28 years old, lives in Ramat Gan.

Four months age (April 2024) I have finished my first degree in computer science, extended single major.
The meaning of "single major extended" simply says that all my elective courses where also computer science.
On the university I gained experienced with C and CPP in OS course, Java in OOP course and a lot of python on all the choice courses because I chose
many ML courses. My most notable progject on my degree was an app developed in Kotlin, python combined with AWS. Which manipulate PDFs.

During almost the last two years (October 22) I'm working as python developer, in student postion.
The company I work on is called Hailo, and my team is the devops team.
My work focus on two parts: building python validation tools. (Like NN generator, and tool monitor)
The second part is to develop different installation methods for different infrastructures and complete products.

### Project from University
An app for analyzing documents.
